# DUNGEON
## Developed by: Vlad Kaparykha
### Disclaimer
The game was developed as part of Grade 11 final assignment.<br>
Unfortunatelly, at the time I wasn't using Git, and only stored files locally on a flashdrive. <br>
So, all the files are lost. The only reason this .exe file exists is because I uploaded it to Drive.<br>
<br>
### Overview
`The Dungeon` is a 2D singleplayer/local PvP survival game. <br>
First time players will have to play through a tutorial, showing off how the controls work. <br>
Once the level begins, the player spawns in the middle of the room, with 3 monsters in each corner.<br>
The goal of the game is to collect money bags, and avoid monsters chasing you. <br>
The more bags you collect, the higher your score will get, but monsters will also get faster. <br>
<br>
### Technical Challenges
- Since the game was developed in Visual Basic, and the executable is .exe, porting the game to mac was a challenge. 
I ended up using `WineBottler` to convert .exe files into .app files, however it wasn't perfect.
